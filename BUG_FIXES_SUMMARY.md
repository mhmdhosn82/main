# Bug Fixes Summary - Iran Insurance Installment Management System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NotificationManager Import Error ✅

**Problem:** 
- Error "cannot import name 'NotificationManager' from 'src.utils'" when pressing payment button
- Occurred when `plyer` package was not installed

**Root Cause:**
- The `src/utils/__init__.py` had a try-except block that silently failed when plyer wasn't available
- Controllers tried to import NotificationManager at runtime, causing ImportError

**Solution:**
- Modified `src/utils/__init__.py` to create a fallback NotificationManager class when plyer is unavailable
- Fallback class logs notifications instead of showing desktop notifications
- Ensures payment functionality works regardless of plyer installation status

**Files Changed:**
- `src/utils/__init__.py`

**Test Results:**
```
✓ NotificationManager imported successfully
✓ All NotificationManager methods present
✓ send_notification works (returned True)
✓ send_payment_confirmation works (returned True)
```

### 2. Installment Reminders Not Updating ✅

**Problem:**
- Installment reminders section was not updating
- Data remained stale when switching between tabs

**Root Cause:**
- No automatic refresh mechanism when user switched to the Installments tab
- Widget only refreshed on manual "Refresh" button click

**Solution:**
- Modified `src/ui/main_window.py` to add auto-refresh on tab activation
- When user switches to Installments tab (index 2), `installment_widget.refresh()` is called
- Also added auto-refresh for Dashboard (index 0) and Calendar (index 3)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Modified `on_tab_changed()` method

**Test Results:**
```
✓ InstallmentWidget created
✓ Reminders loaded correctly (showing 3 upcoming installments)
✓ Refresh works (rows after refresh: 3)
```

---

### 3. Calendar Not Displaying Installments ✅

**Problem:**
- Calendar was not showing due and registered installments
- Installments weren't marked on the Persian calendar

**Root Cause:**
- No automatic refresh when switching to Calendar tab
- Calendar didn't update when data changed in other widgets (e.g., when marking payment)

**Solution:**
- Added auto-refresh for Calendar widget when tab is activated (in `main_window.py`)
- Modified `installment_widget.py` to refresh Calendar and Dashboard after marking payment
- Ensures calendar always shows current data

**Files Changed:**
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Auto-refresh on tab change
- `src/ui/installment_widget.py` - Cross-widget refresh after payment

**Test Results:**
```
✓ CalendarWidget created
✓ Installments loaded on calendar (11 dates with installments)
✓ Refresh works (dates after refresh: 11)
✓ Filters work correctly
```
