# Persian Calendar Fix - Technical Documentation

## Issue Summary

The Persian calendar in the Insurance Installment Management System was crashing when users attempted to navigate beyond Bahman 1404 (approximately February 2026). This prevented users from viewing or managing installments scheduled more than a few months into the future.

## Root Cause

The crash occurred in `src/ui/calendar_widget.py` at line 145 in the `update_calendar()` method. When calculating the number of days in Esfand (the 12th month of the Persian calendar), the code incorrectly called `is_leap()` as an instance method:

```python
# BEFORE (incorrect):
days_in_month = 30 if first_day.is_leap() else 29
```

The `is_leap()` method in the `JalaliDate` class is a static method that requires a year parameter, not an instance method.

### Error Message
```
TypeError: JalaliDate.is_leap() missing 1 required positional argument: 'year'
```

## Solution

Changed the method call to use the correct static method syntax with the year parameter:

```python
# AFTER (correct):
days_in_month = 30 if JalaliDate.is_leap(self.current_jalali.year) else 29
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/ui/calendar_widget.py** (1 line changed)
   - Line 145: Fixed `is_leap()` method call

2. **test_persian_calendar.py** (new file)
   - Added comprehensive test suite for Persian calendar functionality
   - 3 test cases covering navigation, leap years, and date picker

## Testing

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Navigation Test
- ✅ Successfully navigates 60 months (5 years) forward
- ✅ Successfully navigates 60 months backward
- ✅ No crashes during navigation

#### 2. Leap Year Test
- ✅ Leap years correctly show 30 days in Esfand (month 12)
- ✅ Non-leap years correctly show 29 days in Esfand
- ✅ Tested years: 1404-1409

#### 3. Date Picker Test
- ✅ PersianDateEdit widget handles dates 5 years in the future
- ✅ Correct Persian number formatting
- ✅ Correct month name display

### Validation Results

```
Current Persian Year: 1404
Target Year (5 years ahead): 1409
Range Tested: 1404-1409 (60 months)

✓ All navigation successful
✓ All leap year calculations correct
✓ All date picker operations working
✓ No crashes or errors
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Calendar would crash when navigating to month 12 (Esfand)
- Users could not view or manage installments beyond a few months
- Application unusable for long-term planning

### After Fix
- Calendar smoothly navigates at least 5 years into the future
- Users can manage installments for extended periods
- Proper leap year handling ensures correct day counts
- Full calendar functionality restored

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   python3 test_persian_calendar.py
   ```

2. Run the UI component tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_ui_components.py
   ```

3. Manual testing in the UI:
   - Open the calendar widget
   - Click the next month button repeatedly
   - Navigate to Esfand of any year
   - Verify correct day count (29 or 30 based on leap year)

## Technical Details

### Persian Calendar Leap Year Rules
- The Persian calendar follows a 33-year cycle
- Leap years have 30 days in Esfand (month 12)
- Non-leap years have 29 days in Esfand
- Months 1-6 always have 31 days
- Months 7-11 always have 30 days

### JalaliDate.is_leap() Method
```python
# Correct usage:
JalaliDate.is_leap(year)  # Static method, pass year as parameter

# Incorrect usage:
date_instance.is_leap()   # TypeError: missing year argument
```

## Future Considerations

The fix ensures the calendar works for at least 5 years ahead from the current date. Since Persian year 1404 corresponds to 2025-2026 Gregorian:

- **Current coverage**: 1404-1409 (2025-2031 Gregorian)
- **Libraries support**: The `persiantools` and `jdatetime` libraries support much further into the future
- **No further changes needed**: The fix will continue working for many years to come

## Regression Testing

All existing tests continue to pass:
- ✅ UI Component Tests
- ✅ Dashboard Widget
- ✅ Policy Widget  
- ✅ Installment Widget
- ✅ Calendar Widget
- ✅ Reports Widget
- ✅ SMS Widget
- ✅ Persian Date Edit Widget

## Conclusion

This minimal, surgical fix resolves the Persian calendar crash issue by correcting a single method call. The calendar now fully supports date navigation and management for at least 5 years into the future, meeting the requirements specified in the problem statement.
