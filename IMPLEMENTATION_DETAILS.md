# Implementation Summary: Insurance Management System Enhancements

## Changes Made

### 1. Added "مسئولیت" (Responsibility) to Policy Types ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/policy_widget.py` (line 201)
- `src/ui/reports_widget.py` (line 62)

**Changes:**
- Added "مسئولیت" to the policy type dropdown in the policy creation form
- Added "مسئولیت" to the insurance type filter in the reports widget

**Impact:** Users can now create insurance policies of type "مسئولیت" (Responsibility).

### 2. Implemented Overdue Installments Management ✓

**Files Created:**
- `src/ui/overdue_installments_widget.py` - New widget for managing overdue installments

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Added new tab and sidebar item for overdue installments

**Features Implemented:**
- Installments are considered overdue if they are more than 1 month (30 days) past their due date and status is 'pending' or 'overdue'
- New sidebar menu item "⚠️ اقساط معوق" (Overdue Installments)
- New dedicated widget that groups overdue installments by insurance policy
- Each policy group shows:
  - Policy details (number, holder, type)
  - Count of overdue installments
  - Table with installment details including days overdue
- Available operations for each overdue installment:
  - View details (shows full policy and installment information)
  - Mark as paid (updates status and triggers auto-delete check)

**Query Logic:**
```python
one_month_ago = today - timedelta(days=30)
query.filter(
    Installment.due_date < one_month_ago,
    Installment.status.in_(['pending', 'overdue'])
)
```

### 3. Updated Excel Export with Persian Column Headers ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/report_generator.py`

**Changes:**

#### Installment Report Headers:
- Old: `policy_number`, `policy_holder`, `insurance_type`, etc.
- New: `شماره بیمه‌نامه`, `نام بیمه‌گذار`, `نوع بیمه`, `شماره قسط`, `مبلغ`, `تاریخ سررسید`, `تاریخ پرداخت`, `وضعیت`, `روش پرداخت`

#### Policy Summary Report Headers:
- Old: `policy_number`, `policy_holder`, `total_amount`, etc.
- New: `شماره بیمه‌نامه`, `نام بیمه‌گذار`, `نوع بیمه`, `مبلغ کل`, `تعداد اقساط`, `مجموع پرداخت شده`, `مجموع باقی‌مانده`, `وضعیت`

#### Payment Statistics Report Headers:
- Old: `month`, `payment_count`, `total_amount`
- New: `ماه`, `تعداد پرداخت‌ها`, `مجموع مبلغ`

**Impact:** All Excel exports now have Persian column headers in the first row, making reports more user-friendly for Persian speakers.

### 4. Automatic Policy Deletion When All Installments Paid ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/controllers/installment_controller.py`

**Implementation:**
Added a new private method `_check_and_delete_policy_if_all_paid()` that:
1. Checks if all installments for a policy are marked as 'paid'
2. If all are paid, automatically deletes the policy
3. Cascade deletion removes all associated installments
4. Logs the auto-deletion for audit purposes

**Trigger:**
- Called automatically whenever an installment is marked as paid via `mark_as_paid()` method

**Logic:**
```python
def _check_and_delete_policy_if_all_paid(self, policy_id):
    installments = get_all_installments_for_policy(policy_id)
    if all(inst.status == 'paid' for inst in installments):
        delete_policy(policy_id)
```

---

### 5. Added Manual Delete Button for Policies ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/policy_widget.py`

**Changes:**
- Added new "حذف" (Delete) column to the policies table
- Each policy row now has a delete button with red styling
- Clicking delete shows a confirmation dialog warning that it will also delete all related installments
- Calls `PolicyController.delete_policy()` method
- Refreshes the table after successful deletion

**UI Changes:**
- Table now has 8 columns (was 7)
- New column header: "حذف"
- Red delete button for each policy
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions

---

### 6. Changed Custom Date Range to Use Persian Calendar ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/installment_widget.py`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `QDateEdit` with `PersianDateEdit` for custom date range filters
- Updated labels to explicitly mention "شمسی" (Shamsi/Persian)
- Removed QDateEdit import
- Added PersianDateEdit import

**Impact:**
- Users can now select dates using the Persian (Shamsi) calendar instead of Gregorian
- Dates are displayed in Persian format (e.g., "۱۵ فروردین ۱۴۰۳")
- Calendar popup shows Persian months and proper Persian date formatting

**Before:**
```python
self.start_date = QDateEdit()
self.start_date.setDisplayFormat("yyyy/MM/dd")
```

**After:**
```python
from .persian_date_edit import PersianDateEdit
self.start_date = PersianDateEdit()
self.start_date.setDate(QDate.currentDate())
```

## Maintenance Considerations

1. **Overdue Threshold**: Currently hardcoded to 30 days. Could be made configurable if needed.
2. **Auto-Delete**: Logs all auto-deletions for audit trail.
